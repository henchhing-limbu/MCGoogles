# McGoogles
a restaurant called McGoogles, where there are cooks and customers, making and ordering food, respectively. Similarly to our activity in class today, in the main file, you’ll just have to implement the threading code, which will use the McGoogles interface. This should not have any synchronization/locking code! The users of your McGoogles implementation should not have to worry about locking/unlocking anything; they should just be able to use your interface, and it’s the restaurant’s job to worry about safely accessing/modifying the restaurant.  The McGoogles implementation will have all the locking and synchronization (and no threading!). It should ensure that all variables are modified correctly and safely, and that the restaurant is never above capacity. It should also ensure that all orders were fulfilled (number of orders == number of expected orders).
